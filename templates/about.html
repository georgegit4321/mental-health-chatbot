                <h2>About the AI Chatbot for Mental Health</h2>
                <p>Our AI-powered mental health chatbot is designed to provide supportive and non-judgmental conversations for individuals seeking mental health assistance. It offers a safe, private space where users can express their thoughts, feelings, and struggles, helping them manage stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns.</p>
                <p>The chatbot uses advanced artificial intelligence to engage in empathetic conversations, offering coping strategies, mindfulness exercises, and mental health resources tailored to each user’s needs. While the chatbot isn’t a replacement for professional therapy, it serves as an accessible tool to support emotional well-being, guide users through self-care techniques, and encourage healthy mental habits.</p>
                <p>Whether you're looking for a moment of calm, need someone to talk to, or want to learn about mental health management techniques, our AI chatbot is here to help – anytime, anywhere. Its goal is to complement traditional mental health care by offering an easily accessible and immediate resource for support.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> While AI can provide support and information, it’s important to reach out to licensed professionals for ongoing mental health care and treatment.</p>
